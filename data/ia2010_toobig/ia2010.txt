% ====================================                                  
%                                                                       
% The xx2010a graphs are generated from U.S. Census 2010 and Tiger/Line 
% 2010 shapefiles. They are freely available from census.gov web site.  
% The xx prefix in the filenames are the U.S. Postal Service acronyms of
% the state names, e.g.  ny is New York.                                
%                                                                       
% * the vertices are the Census Blocks;                                 
% * two vertices have an edge if and only if the corresponding Census   
%     Blocks share a line segment on their border, i.e. rook-style      
%     neighboring.                                                      
% * each vertex has two weights:                                        
%    (1) Census2010 POP100 or the number of people living in that       
%        Census Block, and.                                             
%    (2) Land Area of the Census Block in square meters                 
% * the edge weights are the pseudo-length of the shared borderlines.   
%     The pseudo-length is calculated using sqrt(x^2 + y^2), x and y    
%     being the differences in longitudes and latitudes of each line    
%     segment on the shared borderlines.  Then the result is multiplied 
%     by 10^7 to make the edge weights integers.                        
% * each Census Block gets identified by a point, and the XY coordinates
%     are the longitudes and latitudes of each point.  The points are   
%     selected by Census to be internal to the Census Blocks, but the   
%     tech doc says that they are not always internal (but always very  
%     close).                                                           
%

% Added to the DIMACS10 collection by Henning Meyerhenke, 2011          
%                                                                       
% The DIMACS10 collection also includes versions of these graphs with   
% unweighted edges.  The two sets have been merged in this collection.  
% If you want the unweighted version, just drop the edge weights on the 
% graphs present in this collection.
